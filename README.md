# GITAM-Virtual-Campus-Tour

VR Project: This specific C# Code was developed and incorporated in the avatars, which were placed near each infrastructure on the campus, which would be helpful to execute a speech to explain the infrastructure visited by the player. Each avatar has a box collider attached to it. As the player reaches the vicinity of the collider, a boolean value "TRUE" is sent to the code, and then it executes.
